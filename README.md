# Mastermind-Game
Attempt at coding the Mastermind Game wit Python and the kivy module for a school assignment.

# AIM OF THE GAME

Find the exact 4-color combination that the computer has randomly created when the game started.
You have to guess the colors but also their exact positions in the sequence !

#   HOW TO PLAY

- Download the code and run the main.py file.
- Click on the left or right arrow buttons to select the white dot that you want to color.
- Then select the color to apply to that dot.
- You can change the colors of your dots as much as you want.
- When you are satisfied with the proposition, click on the "Submit" button to submit your answer.
- The row that you just submitted will now appear on top of the line, and your scores will be in the square on the right.
- You can play until you find the answer !

# TRUTH ABOUT THE CODE...

The code isn't finished.
In the version that is up for the moment, you can win directly by looking for the answer in your console.
If the answer you give is wrong, well... That part has'nt been coded yet.
There's another missing part : the part that deals with an answer submitted that is partially white (e. g. the player hasn't colored every single dot). The program right now doesn't know how to deal with it.
